class EmbeddingFunction(Protocol[D]):
    def __call__(self, input: D) -> Embeddings:
        ...

    def __init_subclass__(cls) -> None:
        super().__init_subclass__()
        # Raise an exception if __call__ is not defined since it is expected to be defined
        call = getattr(cls, "__call__")

        def __call__(self: EmbeddingFunction[D], input: D) -> Embeddings:
            result = call(self, input)
            return validate_embeddings(maybe_cast_one_to_many_embedding(result))

        setattr(cls, "__call__", __call__)

    def embed_with_retries(
        self, input: D, **retry_kwargs: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> Embeddings:
        return cast(Embeddings, retry(**retry_kwargs)(self.__call__)(input))
```

## Programmer's Interpretation:
The provided code snippet defines a `Protocol` class called `EmbeddingFunction` in Python. This class represents an interface for functions that take an input of type `D` and return an `Embeddings` object. Here are the key things to notice:

**1. `@runtime_checkable` Decorator:**
   - This decorator indicates that the `EmbeddingFunction` class is a runtime checkable protocol. This means that Python will dynamically check if an object implements the specified interface at runtime, rather than at compile time.

**2. `__call__` Method:**
   - This method is the core of the protocol and defines the expected behavior of any function that implements `EmbeddingFunction`. It takes an input of type `D` and returns an `Embeddings` object.
   - The `__init_subclass__` method ensures that `__call__` is defined for any subclass of `EmbeddingFunction`, raising an exception if it's not.
   - The `__call__` method also validates the returned `Embeddings` object using the `validate_embeddings` and `maybe_cast_one_to_many_embedding` functions.

**3. `embed_with_retries` Method:**
   - This method provides a convenient way to call the `__call__` method with retry logic. It takes an input of type `D` and optional retry keyword arguments.
   - It uses the `retry` function (likely from a third-party library) to retry the `__call__` method if it fails.

**4. Type Annotations:**
   - The code uses type annotations to specify the expected types of arguments and return values. This can improve code readability and maintainability.

**5. `cast` Function:**
   - The `cast` function is used to tell the type checker that the result of the `retry` function is an `Embeddings` object, even though the type checker might not be able to infer this automatically.

**In summary:**

- The `EmbeddingFunction` protocol defines a common interface for functions that embed data into a numerical representation.
- The `embed_with_retries` method provides a convenient way to call these functions with retry logic.
- Type annotations and the `cast` function are used to improve code readability and maintainability.
